`IWrap` is a wrap widget with a cleaner (but equivalent) layout implementation and an 'insertionIndexAt' method for drag and drop insertion.

(it was forked out from [animated_containers](https://github.com/makoConstruct/animated_containers) after mako realized the container shouldn't be the part that handles animation)
